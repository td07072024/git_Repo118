The polar bear is the largest living species of bear and land carnivore, though some brown bear subspecies like the Kodiak bear can rival it in size.[31][32] Males are generally 200–250 cm (6.6–8.2 ft) long with a weight of 300–800 kg (660–1,760 lb). Females are smaller at 180–200 cm (5.9–6.6 ft) with a weight of 150–300 kg (330–660 lb).[10] Sexual dimorphism in the species is particularly high compared with most other mammals.[33] Male polar bears also have proportionally larger heads than females.[34] The weight of polar bears fluctuates during the year, as they can bulk up on fat and increase their mass by 50 percent.[31] A fattened, pregnant female can weigh as much as 500 kg (1,100 lb).[35] Adults may stand 130–160 cm (4.3–5.2 ft) tall at the shoulder. The tail is 76–126 mm (3.0–5.0 in) long.[10] The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1,002 kg (2,209 lb), was a male shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960.[36]

Compared with the brown bear, this species has a more slender build, with a narrower, flatter and smaller skull, a longer neck, and a lower shoulder hump.[31][37] The snout profile is curved, resembling a "Roman nose".[31] They have 34–42 teeth including 12 incisors, 4 canines, 8–16 premolars and 10 molars. The teeth are adapted for a more carnivorous diet than that of the brown bear, having longer, sharper and more spaced out canines, and smaller, more pointed cheek teeth (premolars and molars).[33][38][37] The species has a large space or diastema between the canines and cheek teeth, which may allow it to better bite into prey.[38][39] Since it normally preys on animals much smaller than it, the polar bear does not have a particularly strong bite.[39] Polar bears have large paws, with the front paws being broader than the back. The feet are hairier than in other bear species, providing warmth and friction when stepping on snow and sea ice.[40] The claws are small but sharp and hooked and are used both to snatch prey and climb onto ice.
