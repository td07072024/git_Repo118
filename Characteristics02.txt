The coat consists of dense underfur around 5 cm (2.0 in) long and guard hairs around 15 cm (5.9 in) long.[10] Males have long hairs on their forelegs, which is thought to signal their fitness to females.[43] The outer surface of the hairs has a scaly appearance, and the guard hairs are hollow, which allows the animals to trap heat and float in the water.[44] The transparent guard hairs forward scatter ultraviolet light between the underfur and the skin, leading to a cycle of absorption and re-emission, keeping them warm.[45] The fur appears white because of the backscatter of incident light and the absence of pigment.[45][46] Polar bears gain a yellowish colouration as they are exposed more to the sun. This is reversed after they moult. It can also be grayish or brownish.[10] Their light fur provides camouflage in their snowy environment. After emerging from the water, the bear can easily shake itself dry since the hairs are resistant to tangling when wet.[47] Oil secretions prevent the hair from freezing.[48] The skin, including the nose and lips, is black and absorbs heat.[10][45] Polar bears have a 5–10 cm (2.0–3.9 in) thick layer of fat underneath the skin,[10] which provides both warmth and energy.[49] Polar bears maintain their core body temperature at about 36.9 °C (98.4 °F).[50] Overheating is countered by a layer of highly vascularized striated muscle tissue and finely controlled blood vessels. Bears also cool off by entering the water.[45][51]

The eyes of a polar bear are close to the top of the head, which may allow them to stay out of the water when the animal is swimming at the surface. They are relatively small, which may be an adaption against blowing snow and snow blindness. Polar bears are dichromats, and lack the cone cells for seeing medium, mainly green, wavelengths. They have many rod cells, which allow them to see at night. The ears are small, allowing them to retain heat and not get frostbitten.[52] They can hear best at frequencies of 11.2–22.5 kHz, a wider frequency range than expected given that their prey mostly makes low-frequency sounds.[53] The nasal concha creates a large surface area, so more warm air can move through the nasal passages.[54] Their olfactory system is also large and adapted for smelling prey over vast distances.[55] The animal has reniculate kidneys which filter out the salt in their food.
